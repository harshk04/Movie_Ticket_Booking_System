# Movie Ticket Booking System

A movie ticket booking system is a software application allowing users to book movie tickets online. This project involves designing and developing a program that provides users with a convenient and free way to book tickets for movies. The primary objective of the system is to allows users to browse movie listings, select a showtime and choose their seats for their tickets online. 
The system is able to handle multiple user requests simultaneously and provide real-time updates on seat availability. The system also includes an administrative panel for managing movie listings, showtimes, and seating arrangements. The admin panel allows theater owners to add new movies, update showtimes, and manage seating arrangements for each theater.
