A movie ticket booking system is a software application allowing users to book movie tickets online. This project involves designing and developing a program that provides users with a convenient and free way to book tickets for movies. The primary objective of the system is to allows users to browse movie listings, select a showtime and choose their seats for their tickets online. 
The system is able to handle multiple user requests simultaneously and provide real-time updates on seat availability. The system also includes an administrative panel for managing movie listings, showtimes, and seating arrangements. The admin panel allows theater owners to add new movies, update showtimes, and manage seating arrangements for each theater.

## Outputs


## Conclusion
The Movie Ticket Booking System in C++ is an implementation of a software system that uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to provide a solution for booking, viewing, and cancelling movie tickets. This project is a practical application of OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which have been used to design and implement the system. The system provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse available movies, select show timings, and book seats. Users can also view their booking history and cancel their reservations if necessary. The administrator has access to additional features like managing movie details, theatre information, and user data.
